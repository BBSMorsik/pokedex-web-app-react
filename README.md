# Pokédex Web App (React + PokeAPI)

Interactive web application built with React that fetches and displays Pokémon data from the public PokeAPI. This project was my introduction to React, where I practiced working with functional components, hooks, and dynamic rendering. The app allows users to browse Pokémon with dynamic search and filtering, view detailed information including stats, types, and abilities, and interact with a responsive UI.

## Technologies Used

React, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, PokeAPI, npm

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/BBSMorsik/pokedex-web-app-react.git
cd pokedex-web-app-react

Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the development server:

npm start

The app will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.


## Future Improvements

Add pagination for Pokémon lists, implement advanced search and filter options, add unit tests for components using Jest/React Testing Library, and improve UI design and animations.
